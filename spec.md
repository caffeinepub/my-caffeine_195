# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a visible "Admin Panel" button to the main navigation header so users can access the admin route without manually typing a URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an "Admin Panel" link/button to the desktop navigation bar in `Header.tsx` that navigates to `#/admin`
- Add the same "Admin Panel" link/button to the mobile navigation menu in `Header.tsx`
- Style the button to match the existing maroon/gold theme

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see and click an "Admin Panel" button directly in the navigation on both desktop and mobile, which takes them to the admin login/panel page.
