Most requirements are met, but the actual UPI QR code image asset (upi-qr-code.dim_400x500.png) is not present in the diff, and the BHIM UPI branding label is not confirmed in the truncated code.",

      "reason": "No image file was added (ADDED FILES: none). The actual image asset upi-qr-code.dim_400x500.png is absent from the added files list. BHIM UPI branding label presence cannot be confirmed as the DonationSection.tsx diff is truncated.",
