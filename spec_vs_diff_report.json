  "summary": "The diff modifies GallerySection.tsx to display four Admin Meet photos with the correct event title and subtitle, and updates project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt. However, the image filenames used in the component differ from what was specified in the requirements: the component references '.dim_1200x800.png' suffixed filenames instead of the plain '.png' filenames required. Additionally, there is no evidence in the diff of the actual image files being saved as static assets.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added files under frontend/public/assets/generated/. The image files themselves are not present in the diff. Furthermore, the component references '.dim_1200x800.png' filenames (e.g., 'gallery-admin-meet-1.dim_1200x800.png') instead of the required plain '.png' filenames (e.g., 'gallery-admin-meet-1.png').",
