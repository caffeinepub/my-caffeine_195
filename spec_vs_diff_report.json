  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements (REQ-70 through REQ-81), including the AdminPanel with passcode gate, backend gallery API, React Query hooks, tabbed admin interface, change passcode feature, routing, header admin link, dynamic GallerySection, scroll animations, hover animations, and hero entrance animations. However, several specific requirements have gaps or are only partially implemented based on the available evidence.",

      "reason": "GallerySection.tsx only imports and uses useGetGalleryEvents. It renders event.images directly from the event object. The useGetGalleryImagesByEvent hook is not used in GallerySection, so images are not separately fetched per event as specified in REQ-77.",
