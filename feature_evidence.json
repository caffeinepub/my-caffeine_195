      "featureTitle": "Investigate and fix the error occurring in the Admin Panel > Villages tab when attempting to add a district. The red error text visible on the UI indicates the `addDistrict` mutation is failing. Diagnose whether the issue is: (1) a backend authorization/permission check rejecting the call (admin-only guard), (2) a mismatch between the frontend mutation arguments and the backend `addDistrict(name: Text)` function signature, (3) an actor initialization issue causing the mutation to fail silently, or (4) an error in the `useAddDistrict` React Query mutation hook (wrong method name, incorrect argument shape, or missing actor reference). Fix the root cause so that submitting the Add District form in the Villages tab successfully calls the backend, adds the district, invalidates the districts query, and shows a success toast instead of a red error message.",
